## Description

For this project, I have created a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app was created using Mongoose

This app will allow you to view, create, update and delete your users, thoughts and reactions in an API client like Insomnia.

You can see walk through videos of this app in action below:
